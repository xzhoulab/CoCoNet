Description: CoCoNet incorporates tissue-specific gene co-expression networks constructed from either bulk or single cell RNA sequencing studies into GWAS data for trait-tissue inference. In particular, CoCoNet relies on a covariance regression network model to express gene-level effect sizes for the given GWAS trait as a function of the tissue-specific co-expression adjacency matrix. With a composite likelihood-based inference algorithm, CoCoNet is scalable to tens of thousands of genes.
